# ML Library

## Streamlining Machine Learning Pipelines

The `Machine Learning` class is a versatile Python tool designed to simplify the creation, optimization, and evaluation of machine learning pipelines. It integrates smoothly with popular libraries such as scikit-learn, Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, and SHAP for model interpretation.

### Example Usage

For a detailed example using `MLCore`, refer to the `xxxx.ipynb` notebook in this repository. This example demonstrates how to leverage `modue` to streamline the development and optimization of machine learning models.

### Dataset

To get started, you can use a dataset like the [Mobile Phone Price Prediction Cleaned Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ganjerlawrence/mobile-phone-price-prediction-cleaned-dataset/data) from Kaggle. This dataset provides a practical scenario for applying `MLCore` to predictive modeling tasks.


### Setting Up Your Azure ML Workspace

To streamline common tasks and automate complex commands, this project includes a Makefile. You can use make <command> to execute specific tasks defined within the Makefile. For instance:

## Step 1: Create a Compute Instance

Start by creating a compute instance to run your notebooks.

## Step 2: Install Poetry and Dependencies

Execute the following command to install `poetry` and its dependencies:

```bash
make setup
```

This command will trigger the setup process as defined in the `Makefile`. For a comprehensive list of available commands and their functionalities, refer to the `Makefile` itself.

> **Note:** If you want to run your notebooks within this virtual environment, you need to add the created environment to the list of available kernels.

## Step 3: Push Code to Notebooks

You can push your code to the notebooks using either SSH or HTTP. If you choose SSH, follow these steps:

1. Generate an SSH key inside the created compute instance.
2. Add this SSH key to your Git repository platform.

Once you've set up your environment, you can proceed with the `Getting_Your_Data.ipynb` notebook to understand how to retrieve data, set up your environment, and run jobs.
